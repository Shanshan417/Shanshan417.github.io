I learned fundamental Python skills, including data processing, regression modeling, and basic machine learning techniques.During the learning process, I also mastered the standard workflow for handling data after acquisition.This includes first checking the data quality by identifying missing values, outliers, and duplicates;then cleaning the data by filling in missing values, removing outliers, standardizing numerical features, or encoding categorical variables;conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to observe relationships between variables;and finally selecting an appropriate modeling method based on the data characteristics, such as linear regression. Here are some of what I've learned.

## Career Objectives

Perhaps influenced by personal interests, I have always been very concerned about the source and quality of food. As a graduate student majoring in Business Analysis at Lehigh University, I am passionate about applying data-driven analysis methods to real-world problems. My career goal is to contribute to the agricultural industry, improve food safety levels through data analysis, optimize agricultural supply chains, and promote the development of sustainable agriculture. With my professional abilities in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I hope to build a bridge between technology and agriculture, helping to create a smarter and more resilient modern agricultural system.
