## Career Objectives

Perhaps influenced by personal interests, I have always been very concerned about the source and quality of food. As a graduate student majoring in Business Analysis at Lehigh University, I am passionate about applying data-driven analysis methods to real-world problems. My career goal is to contribute to the agricultural industry, improve food safety levels through data analysis, optimize agricultural supply chains, and promote the development of sustainable agriculture. With my professional abilities in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I hope to build a bridge between technology and agriculture, helping to create a smarter and more resilient modern agricultural system.
